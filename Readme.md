### Contribution

No specific rule. Just be kind to everyone and hear all the silly ideas. This whole project started from a silly idea. While making this I learnt that sometimes silly ways might work better than traditional methods. This project is like some kind of Research & Development. The first solution generally never works ðŸ˜‚. So in case you are stuck, don't worry. We can do it together. ðŸ’ª

In case you go through the code and feel like you can make it easier for others to understand by writing inline comments or documentation, feel free to open a PR.

This is a creative project and there is no limit to creativity. If you have got a new idea (big or small), please open an issue.

### Development

- Clone the repo
- Run `yarn && yarn dev`
- Open http://localhost:3000 on any browser
